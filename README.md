# Ward Animal Shelter
This site is a site created to give to the City of Ward, Arkansas Animal Shelter. Currenlty they only have a facebok page and have no way to show what animals they have up for adoption. I created this site with hopes of presenting it to the animal shelter so that they can use it one day. 
This site is made up of dummy data just to show what it could be. You are shown the featured pets of the shelter as well as any dogs, cats and other types of animals that may be avaliable.
